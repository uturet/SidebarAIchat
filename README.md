# [SidebarAI Chat](https://sidebaraichat.com)

This repository contains the static landing page for SidebarAI Chat. The project aims to bring any AI model into your browser without subscriptions by letting you plug in your own API key and start chatting.

## Features

- Select from multiple AI models.
- Upload text-based files such as TXT, CSV, JSON or XML directly into the chat.
- Save and manage conversations with ease.
- Send messages with highlighted code; LaTeX support is planned.
- Add multiple assistants and custom instructions for tailored prompts.

The site is still under development, so expect updates as features mature.
